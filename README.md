An AI-powered structural defect detection engine built using Google Gemini for multimodal understanding. The solution includes:

Image Upload & Preprocessing: o Site engineers upload construction site images via a front-end interface (Streamlit). o Images are preprocessed for size normalization and noise reduction.

AI-Powered Defect Detection: o The model analyzes the images to identify construction defects such as:  Concrete cracks  Honeycombing  Plaster inconsistencies  Surface irregularities o Google Gemini API is integrated for high-fidelity visual and contextual understanding.

Structured Output Generation: o Results are returned in a structured tabular format with:  Defect type  Location (Zone/Floor)  Severity (Low/Medium/High)  Suggested corrective actions

Downloadable Reports: o Output can be exported into Word/PDF format for compliance and audit purposes.
